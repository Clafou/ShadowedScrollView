Usage
-----

Anywhere you instantiate a UIScrollView, specify this class instead. ShadowedScrollView is a subclass of UIScrollView which add Safari-style gradients around the content view.

For example, replace:
	UIScrollView *scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];

With this:
	UIScrollView *scrollView = [[ShadowedScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
